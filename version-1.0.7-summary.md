# Neo N3 MCP Server v1.0.7 - Summary

## Overview

Version 1.0.7 of the Neo N3 MCP Server introduces comprehensive testing for transaction status tracking and fee estimation functionality. This release focuses on enhancing test reliability and cross-platform compatibility, particularly for Windows PowerShell environments.

## Key Improvements

### Transaction Status Testing

The new `transaction-status-test.js` provides thorough testing for all possible transaction states:

1. **Confirmed Transactions**: Validates that completed transactions show the correct confirmation count and block details
2. **Pending Transactions**: Ensures that transactions in the mempool are correctly identified as pending
3. **Not Found Transactions**: Properly handles and reports transactions that don't exist on the blockchain

### Fee Estimation Testing

A dedicated testing module for the fee estimation functionality:

1. **Gas Cost Calculation**: Verifies that gas costs are calculated correctly
2. **Safety Buffer**: Confirms that the safety buffer is properly applied to estimated costs
3. **Mock Response Handling**: Tests the system's ability to parse and process RPC responses

### Cross-Platform Compatibility

1. **Windows PowerShell Support**: Fixed command execution patterns for Windows environments
2. **Test Isolation**: Improved mock implementation with proper cleanup between tests
3. **Reliable Test Runner**: Enhanced test script with better error reporting
